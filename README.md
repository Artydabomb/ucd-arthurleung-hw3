<ol>
  <li>Password length (the password has a condition that it cannot be shorter than 8 characters or 128 characters.)</li>
  <li>Lower case characters (the user is asked if they would like to have lower case characters in the password).</li> 
  <li>Upper case characters (the user is asked if they would like to have upper case characters in the password).</li>
  <li>Special characters (the user is asked if they would like to have special characters in the password).</li>
